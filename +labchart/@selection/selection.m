    Might create a flag indicating whether or not the selection is linked
    ...
    %TODO: This seems necessary, as even getting it from the document
    %and updating it isn't sufficient to cause the document to use the
    selection
    
    The problem is that the selection is ill defined until
    it is fully specified. The updates should probably be a method then
    like makeSelection
    - selectPoint
    - selectSpan
    
    Creation Methods:
    1) s = actxserver('ADIChart.Selection')
    2) doc.SelectionObject
